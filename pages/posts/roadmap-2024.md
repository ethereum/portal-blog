# Portal Network Roadmap Draft 2024

This document aims to outline the 2024 core team & product roadmap for Portal Network.


## Team description

The Portal Network core team is a small (<15 person) collaborative effort focused on bulding a decentralized peer-to-peer network for storing and serving data from the execution and consensus layers of the Ethereum protocol. The Portal project is composed of three independent client teams each implementing the Portal Network specification in different languages: Trin (Rust), Ultralight (Typescript) and Fluffy (Nim), plus cross-client efforts to build out tooling and testing infrastructure. 

Our sustained focus is on shipping the minimum network functionality necessary to serve all of the Execution layer data.  This includes the three client implementations which each support the three sub-protocols that house and serve this data, tooling such as our network health monitor ((GladOS)[https://github.com/ethereum/glados]), interoperability testing via Hive, and the "bridge" node functionality which is responsible for pushing data into the Portal Network.

Additionally, we allocate a significant portion of our time to support the practical adoption of this technology by client and app teams around the world.

## Portal mission & vision

The overall vision for Portal Network is to ***provide the infrastructure needed for anyone to access Ethereum data in a decentralized way with minimal hardware and bandwidth requirements.***

Portal Network is a public good that aims to become a core piece of infrastructure for many Ethereum-based applications. It will provide decentralized API access to Ethereum execution and consensus data and support several pathways to lightweight Ethereum clients. 

There are currently three primary sub-protocols that the Portal team are committed to shipping as priority deliverables in 2024:

- History network
- State network
- Beacon network

These sub-protocols are prioritized because together they provide verifiable access to the full Ethereum dataset in a manner that is fully decentralized and accessible on resource constrained devices. 

Specifically: 

- The History sub-protocol enables Ethereum execution clients to expire historical data via EIP-4444, safe in the knowledge that the data is available on request from the Portal Network. 
- The State sub-protocol gives light clients access to Ethereum stata data, exposing methods such as `eth_getProof` that eliminate the need for trusted third party RPC providers. 
- The Beacon sub-protocol gives light clients access to the latest block headers so that they can be confident they are following the canonical Ethereum chain.

Shipping these features will enable ***major upgrades for the Ethereum ecosystem as a whole***. These features have been in development for several years and have been through several rounds of refinement and course correction. Now Portal Network is on the brink of shipping these sub-networks into production. 

This is why ***2024 is a set to be a standout year for Portal Network.***

Longer term, there are proposals for more sub-protocols that serve granular transaction data, blob data, proofs etc, but these are out of scope for 2024.

    - Key result 2: Portal team have agreed and begun to implement a design for a two-way bridge to Ethereum to enable transaction forwarding from Portal --> Ethereum


## Where are we now?

The Portal Network has existed for 5 years, during which time there have been substantial course corrections and redesigns in response to the evolving wider Ethereum landscape. Today, Portal Network actively deploying infrastructure that will benefit large parts of the Ethereum ecosystem. 2024 is expected to be a pivotal year, where we focus on moving what were previously R&D projects into production and focusing on growing adoption for our core features: the History network, State network and Beacon network.

In the first instance, users will be expected to run Portal clients to expose a subset of Ethereum RPC methods. The list of methods will grow steadily over the first half of 2024 until almost all of the `eth` namespace methods can be served from Portal data. However, we also intend to collaborate with Ethereum client teams to help them to implement the Portal specification directly in existing execution clients, circumventing the need to run additional clients. 

## How did we get here?

Having established the current state of Portal network, it is useful to reflect on the previous year to understand how we arrived here and what lessons we will carry forward into 2024.

### 2023 year in review

Overall, 2023 has been a good year for the Portal Network.

There were major advances in all three Portal clients, Glados and the testing infrastructure. Below we outline some specific successes from the previous year:

#### Successes in 2023

- Features shipped:
    - History network (alpha)
    - Beacon network (alpha)
    - Glados network monitoring tool
    - Testing framework (Portal Hive)
- Conference talks:
    - \> 5 talks dedicated to Portal Network were delivered at major ETH events in 2023
- Team growth:
    - several new team members have joined in 2023
- Collaborations:
    - many new connections with app and client teams
- Communications:
    - new website and blog

This activity has set the stage for 2024 to be a pivotal year for Portal Network as some key sub-protocols move from alpha into production.

As well as successes, there were some frustrations for the Portal Network team in 2023:


## 2024 workstreams

To achieve our mission, weâ€™re focused on 5 major workstreams that comprise our roadmap.

### 1) Trin

- The Fluffy team is especially focused on....
- Specific challenges they might encounter in delivering the 2024 roadmap include...

### 3) Ultralight

- The Ultralight team comprises N developers.
- Ultralight developers also work on tooling such as Glados and maintaining the testing infrastructure.
- The Ultralight team is especially focused on....
- Specific challenges they might encounter in delivering the 2024 roadmap include...
...
### 4) Glados

- Glados is worked on by developers from the three main client teams, with some individuals taking more prominent roles than others. 
- Scaling is going to be a challenge for Glados in 2024. The tool may have to migrate to an EF managed server so we can benefit from devops support and handle large volumes of traffic.
- Glados is also going to be extremely important in 2024 because it is the early warning system for problems with any of the Portal sub-protocols. It might be worth refining a dedicated process and schedule around Glados maintenance to ensure the team can be very responsive to any issues. 

### 5) Communications
- The Portal website and blog will become increasingly important as the primary outlet for public facing materials related to the Portal Network.
- Portal Network team members will start providing regular updates for the Portal blog to increase transparency to the outside world.


## Risks for 2024

Potential hurdles or challenges that would prevent our team from completing our priorities

1) **Integration risks**
- **Risk 1** it is possible that we have overestimated the demand for Portal Network infrastructure. We do not expect this to be true because we have explicitly surveyed client and app teams and we sense that there is pent up enthusiasm for the benefits Portal Network confers.

    **Mitigation**: - If it turns out we have overestimated demand for History, State or Beacon data we will reconnect with client and app teams to explain the benefits in more detail, and also put additional effort into public-facing communications including more frequent blog posts and articles. We will also focus on revisiting fundamental concepts such as "don't trust, verify" and the problems with relying on centralized RPC providers.


2) **Implementation risks**
- what is the worst case scenario if we ship history, state or beacon networks with bugs?
- how are we going to mitigate those risks
- what if one client lags the others and can't make feature parity?
- how could someone attack the Portal Network, and how can we protect it?

1) **Technical complexity**

- Portal is shipping new technology without good historical analogs. Each client is complex and navigating uncharted territory.
- Mitigation includes Portal hive, fuzz testing etc


## Summary

2024 is shaping up to be a pivotal year for the Portal Network. The time has come for Portal Network to capitalize on several years of research and development and finally push some very valuable infrastructure into production. We expect that this will have positive effects across the Ethereum ecosystem.
However, we are aware of several risks and have put sensible mitigation strategies in place, particularly around testing and monitoring infrastructure. We are also focusing on improving our public facing communication through the website and blog.
